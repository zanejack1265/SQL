1) Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "USA";

2) Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, customerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

3) Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.invoiceid, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry

    WHERE invoices.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

4) Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

5) Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry

6) Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT inv.invoiceid, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
    FROM chinook.employees emp

    ON emp.employeeid = cust.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
    ON cust.customerid = inv.customerid;
    
7) Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT inv.Total, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName

JOIN chinook.employees emp
    ON emp.employeeid = cust.SupportRepid;

8) How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT count(invoiceid)
    FROM chinook.invoices

SELECT SUM(Total)
    FROM chinook.invoices
        WHERE invoicedate LIKE "2009%";

10) Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT inv.invoicelineid, track.Name, inv.trackid
    FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.tracks track
    ON track.trackid = inv.trackid;

11) Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT inv.invoicelineid, track.Name as 'track name', art.Name as 'artist'
    FROM chinook.tracks track
JOIN chinook.invoice_items inv
    ON track.trackid = inv.trackid
JOIN chinook.albums alb
    ON track.albumid = alb.albumid
JOIN chinook.artists art
    ON art.artistid = alb.artistid;

12) Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT track.name as 'Track Name', alb.title as 'Album', med.name as 'Media Type', gen.name as 'Genre'

JOIN chinook.genres gen
    ON gen.genreid = track.genreid;

13) Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

    FROM chinook.invoices inv

    ON emp.employeeid = cust.SupportRepid
GROUP BY emp.employeeid;

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, Round(SUM(inv.total), 2)

JOIN chinook.employees emp
    ON emp.employeeid = cust.SupportRepid
WHERE inv.invoicedate LIKE "2009%"
GROUP BY emp.employeeid
ORDER by (Round(SUM(inv.total), 2)) desc
LIMIT 1;

15) Show all of the tracks that sold at least 2 quantities, listed in alphabetical order.

SELECT SUM(inv.quantity), track.name
    FROM chinook.tracks track

    ON track.trackid = inv.trackid
GROUP BY inv.trackid
    HAVING SUM(inv.quantity) >= 2
ORDER by track.name asc;
